# quick_resources

Resources to learn something quickly. I will start only with the resources I know (and some of them I tried), but you are free to make a pull request.

Every resource listed here is intended for beginners and will be in English, if not stated otherwise.

# GIT
* https://learngitbranching.js.org/ - nice visuals, on-site practice

# SQL
* https://pgexercises.com/ - on-site practice, **ONLY QUERYING IS COVERED, TABLE CREATION, RELATIONS AND OPTIMIZATIONS ARE NOT**

# RUST
* https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/ - on-site practice (playing with the working code), dry, more concepts and better order compared to Rust Book
* https://practice.rs/ - like RbE (item above), but with unfinished code that you need to finish (actually haven't checked it all, it may be bad, but I think it is worth trying nonetheless)
* https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa - non-trivial stuff, reimplementing the standard library, **NOT FOR BEGINNERS**
* https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlb7e2G7aSpTfhiECYNI2EZ1uAluUqE_e - Kladov's lessons, **IN RUSSIAN**

# PYTHON
* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
