# quick_resources
Resources to learn something quickly. I will start only with the resources I know (and some of them I tried), but you are free to make a pull request.

Every resource listed here is intended for beginners and will be in English, if not stated otherwise.

Every resource listed here **should be** free and easy to understand.

It is **highly likely** that every resource here has practice right next to theory. When adding new resources, prefer resources with practice.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    + https://learngitbranching.js.org/ - nice visuals, on-site practice
* [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)
    + https://pgexercises.com/ - on-site practice, **ONLY QUERYING IS COVERED; TABLE CREATION, RELATIONS AND OPTIMIZATIONS ARE NOT**
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
    + https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/ - on-site practice (playing with the working code), dry, more concepts and better order compared to Rust Book
    + https://practice.rs/ - like RbE (item above), but with unfinished code that you need to finish (actually haven't checked it all, it may be bad, but I think it is worth trying nonetheless)
    + https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa - non-trivial stuff, reimplementing the standard library, **NOT FOR BEGINNERS**
    + https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlb7e2G7aSpTfhiECYNI2EZ1uAluUqE_e - Kladov's lessons, **best theory in Russian, but no exercises**
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    + https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html - official Python docs, may be too dry
    + ML/DS libraries:
        - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html - official introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn
        - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matplotlib/matplotlib_quick_guide.htm - briefly about matplotlib, **NOT COMPREHENSIVE**
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0_FRiX-sw - brief introduction to PyTorch
* [Golang (aka Go)](https://go.dev/)
    + https://go.dev/tour - official **QUICK** go tour with interactive examples and a few exercises. It is quick because GO is small by itself
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
    + https://javascript.info/ - very good tutorial, but **ONLY FOR BEGINNERS!** Too much water in the beginning. On-site excercises. Russian version exists: https://learn.javascript.ru/
* [General ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (**YOU NEED MATH FOR THAT!** Linear models and basics of statictics, to be exact)
    + https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/ - very detailed blog about general computer vision and how machine learning models work
    + Note: also see "Python"->"ML/DS libraries"
    + https://t.me/mishin_learning - useful telegram channel about ML things, **in Russian**
    + https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course/word_embeddings.html#research_thinking - best transformer models manual
    + https://horace.io/brrr_intro.html - how GPU and block-distributed computation works
    + https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 - a key article explaining how the attention algorithm works
    + https://medium.com/towards-data-science - articles and tutorials from data scientists
    + https://machinelearningmastery.com/ - simply about complicated things (about ML)
